1Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1A) When working from another computer or when collaborating with someone else.

2Q) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

2A) Because Git will not know which branch I'd like to pull or whether the branch being pulled is "ready" to incorporate with my code.
